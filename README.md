# SoilMoistureProfiles
 The code computes vertical soil moisture profiles given conceptual **(e.g., CFE)** and layered **(e.g., LGAR)** soil revervoirs.
 Inputs include **total soil moisture storage** and change in the **soil moisture storage per timestep**
 For conceptual reservoir, the algorithm has two steps.
  * Find water table location using Netwon iterative scheme
  * Use Clap-Hornberger soil moisture characteristic function to compute vertical profile
